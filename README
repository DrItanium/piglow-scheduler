The piglow-scheduler is a program which takes in three separate input channels
and schedules each channel on a leg of a piglow (right now I'm coupling it with
my fluxstandardin and fluxstandardout programs to transfer the piglow µops over
the network to colorsmithwide).

This tool only converts streams of data into 19 byte wide µops. Each leg µop is
7 bytes wide and consists of 6 bytes led and 1 byte delay. The delay byte is
translated into n copies of the µop minus the delay byte which is fed in
sequence into multiple piglow µops. For instance,

If we have the µop with contents: 
	50 50 50 50 50 50 3 

Then for the next four time instances the µop from this channel will be

50 50 50 50 50 50

It is four instead of three since it is necessary to actually set the leds for
one cycle and then keep them on for the next three which translates to four. 


After those four time instances have passed then the next 7 bytes are read in
and the process happens again until we run out of bytes on that channel.

If that happens then the last values seen are used until all channels are
exhausted.
